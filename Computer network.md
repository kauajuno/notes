First things first, a computer network is a set of devices that can share resources and information to each other through their connections. Those devices can be computers, printers, routers, smartphones, and many other hardware devices. These devices are often called nodes, and their connections are called links. The devices are able to communicate to each other via protocols, which are rules that provide a standard of communication so nodes can understand each other.
