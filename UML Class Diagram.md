UML class diagrams are structural diagrams which are essential in the modeling process of a system as they model the static structure of it. A single class diagram can depict the structure of an entire system, implying that more shall be used for more complex systems as each class diagram represents a component of it.

Class diagrams are very useful in different stages of the system design, such as in the analysis stage, where the diagram can help you understand the requirements of the problem domain and identify its concepts; or in the early stages of software projects where some classes are directly translated into actual software classes and objects; or even somewhere later in the development, as the early models can be refined to create a class diagram that represents specific subsystems, logical implementations (more correlated to the code itself), etc.

# Elements

Inside UML class diagrams, the following elements can be found:

## Classes

In UML, a class represents an object or a set of objects that share a satisfying amount of characteristic that justifies them being represented by a single class.

## Objects

Objects are elements that represent instances of classes. It's important to distinguish these objects from the objects of the domain. These objects are merely instances of a class, they're also representing something abstract, they're not the concrete element that exist in the domain of the problem itself.

## Packages

Packages group similar model elements.
