Tailwind is arguably the best [[CSS]] framework out there. For a considerable number of reasons.

Tailwind is based on low-level classes wrote directly on markup instead of relying on predefined custom CSS or writing it by yourself, known as a **utility-first** approach. It comes with a generous default style configuration, but is easy to customize (you're even encouraged to do so). This default configuration implies that you are using a predefined **design system**, which is the main difference from basically writing inline CSS (there's also responsiveness and states which aren't inline CSS features).
