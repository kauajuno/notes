UML means Unified Modeling Language, and it is a language created to standardize the communication between software engineers, software architects and software developers along the many phases of software development, providing ways to depict the design.

# What can you do with UML?

What can you do with a modeling language? Well, models. But it's deeper than that. A model is always a model of something, it represents something. Most of the times it represents a system within some domain. The model abstracts details from the system from a certain point of view and for a certain purpose.

A UML model consists of three categories of elements:

- classifiers: a classifier describes a set of objects.
- events: an event describes a set of possible occurrences.
- behaviors: a behavior describes a set of possible executions.

Models do not contain objects, occurrences or executions, because these are part of the domain being modeled, not the models themselves.
