COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) is a framework focused on helping to understanding, designing and implementing IT governance. COBIT has 6 versions ever since its conception, as we currently have COBIT 2019 as the most recent version. It is split in 4 publications: Introduction and Methodology; Governance and Management Objectives; Designing an Information and Technology Governance Solution and Implementing; and Optimizing an Information and Technology Governance Solution.

# Context

Most medium/big successful enterprises had to deal with a lot of I&T in some way for the last years, leading to the creation of [[Enterprise Governance of Information and Related Technologies|EGIT]] (Enterprise Governance of Information and Technology). But there's a problem: there isn't some golden formula that shall be followed in order to create the ideal EGIT. Each enterprise has to tailor its own EGIT given its unique context and needs, and this is where COBIT shows its value: tailoring the ideal EGIT for the enterprise.

# Value delivery

EGIT's primary objective is creating value while mitigating associated risks. COBIT complements this by ensuring IT investments preserve that tangible value and discard unproductive expenditures through resource optimization.

>EGIT is not an entity inside the IT department, but it definitely influences it as well as the other entities of an enterprise that somehow deal with I&T.

# Governance and Management

COBIT draws a line to differ governance from management. Even though they might be some enterprise's core pieces, they perform different activities and serve different purposes.

## Governance

The governance assures that stakeholders needs are treated with equity, a direction is set for the enterprise and performance and compliance are monitored.

## Management

Management takes the goals set by the enterprise and translates it into a plan of activities, which is then ran and monitored by the management itself.

# Objectives

Objectives are the main construct inside of COBIT, there are 40 of them. Some of them may be achieved by an enterprise so that its EGIT brings value from the use of information and technology.

Each governance or management objective always relates to one process and some other related [[#Components|components]] to help achieve the objective. COBIT distinguishes governance objectives from management objectives as well as the concepts themselves, and each of them relate respectively to a governance process and a management process.

The 40 objectives are grouped in five different domains.

Governance objectives are grouped in the EDM domain, while management objectives are split into the APO, BAI, DSS and MEA domains.
