Most programmers starting on Spring have their first question being "what's the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?" so let's tackle this first. Spring Boot is built on top of the [[Spring]] Framework, but it is designed to simplify the development of Spring-based applications by reducing boilerplate code and configuration. In the same sense that Spring aims to simplify the development of Java enterprise applications, Spring Boot aims to simplify the development of Spring applications.

As you're beginning in Spring, it's not going to be easy nor is it necessary to understand in which ways Spring Boot simplifies Spring development, but after you've learned some things it might be good to see what's ahead.
