TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This statement is preceded by the question, "What features does TypeScript have that JavaScript doesn't?". The name itself hints at the answer: TypeScript introduces type checking at compile time, to start with. But there's much more. TypeScript extends JavaScript with enhanced classes, interfaces, namespaces, and better tooling.

To summarize, the greatest advantage TypeScript has over JavaScript is its ability to prevent bugs. Many programmers who have worked with both JavaScript and TypeScript testify that TypeScript has prevented more bugs than any unit testing setup ever could.
