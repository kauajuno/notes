Web development is a subset of the software development that refers to the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites or web applications that run on a web browser. Web development is a broad concept, but most of it can be summarized into two more specific terms.

# [[Front-end]]

Front-end is all about what is being displayed to the user. The layout, the colors, the elements on the screen, all of that is what matters to the front-end development.

# [[Back-end]]

Back-end is all about what is not being displayed to the user, but is essential for things to work as expected to provide the functionality of the software. Server-side logic, data storage and management, security, all of those are back-end concerns.
