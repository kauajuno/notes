CREATE is a framework created by Stephen-Wendell that helps understanding user behavior and improve UX. CREATE is actually an acronym for "Cue, Reaction, Evaluation, Ability, Timing, Experience", which are respectively the 5 stages the user needs to pass through in order to do some action and the result of it. It is referred to as an action funnel because along the 5 stages it is possible to "lose" the user to something, which is the main idea of the framework: you don't want to lose the user along the funnel, in fact you'll design an UX that is good enough to keep your user through that tunnel.

- Cue is the trigger that brings the idea of an action to your mind.
- Reaction is the emotional instinct the user will have after receiving that idea.
- Evaluation is the calculus done by the user of the cost-benefit ratio of the action.
- Ability is the parameter that measures if the user has what it takes to perform the action.
- Timing is about how urgent that action is.
