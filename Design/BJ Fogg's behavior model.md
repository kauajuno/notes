BJ Fogg is a american social scientist who proposed a model in which behavior is defined by the combination of three factors: motivation, ability and prompt.

In this model:

- If a person lacks motivation, they wonâ€™t perform the behavior, even if it's easy and there's a prompt.
- If a person lacks ability (it's too difficult), they won't do it, even if they're motivated and prompted.
- If there's no prompt, the behavior won't happen, even if they have motivation and ability.

The graph representation would look like this, where above the curve the prompt is successful, and otherwise it isn't.
