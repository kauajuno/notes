Design got to be one of the hardest words to define without having to think too much, much due to the fact that design is a matter of concern of a lot of knowledge areas, such as problem solving, aesthetics and communication. A possible generic description for design could be that stated in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design): design is the concept of or proposal for an object, process, or system. The word, design, refers to something that is or has been intentionally created by a thinking agent, although it is sometimes used to refer to the inherent nature of something â€“ its design.
