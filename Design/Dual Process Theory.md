The Dual Process Theory is a psychology theory states that the human thinking process operates at two different levels, an intuitive and fast one and an slow and logical one, they're known as System 1 and System 2, respectively. Understanding this theory can be very helpful for UX designers in order to design experiences that fit both "modes".

# System 1 and System 2

Let's detail how each of the systems work:

## System 1

- **fast** and **automatic** thinking.
- operates **effortlessly** and **unconsciously**.
- based on **intuition**, **instinct**, and **heuristics** (mental shortcuts).
- handles routine tasks like recognizing faces or responding to dangers quickly.
- more prone to biases and errors due to its reliance on gut feelings.
- example: Reacting quickly to avoid a car when crossing the street.

## System 2

- **slow**, **deliberate**, and **analytical** thinking.
- requires **conscious effort** and **attention**.
- engages in **logical reasoning**, **problem-solving**, and **critical thinking**.
- useful for complex decisions that require thoughtful consideration.
- more reliable but consumes more mental energy and time.
- example: Solving a math problem or deciding on a long-term financial plan.

# Designing good UX for both systems

In order to design good UX for both System 1 and System 2, the following practices may be adopted by the UX designer:

- **make tasks simple and intuitive**
- **care to put visual cues**
- **minimize and handle errors**
- **test on prototypes**
