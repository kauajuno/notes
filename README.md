By the time I'm writing this, I really don't know if anyone but me will ever read this, but as long as me from the future read this somewhere in time I'm happy enough. Hi! You can call me Mentales.

This introduction is one of the things I intend to never change, because I don't want the purpose of this to ever change. This whole set of files is a body of knowledge made from everything I'll learn and review from now on. I'm doing this for three main reasons.

First reason: this is going to be REALLY cool someday. I mean, it's almost like I'm writing a book in some freestyle mode. Second is that I feel like I learn much better from taking notes and this feels like a nice way to take notes. Third one is that MAYBE someday this might help someone.

I think it'd be more likely for me to help someone with this if I wrote it in Brazilian Portuguese, I'm Brazilian and know a lot of people here after all. But I'd like to get better at writing in English and it would also be crazy if I could somehow help anyone from far away. If I can be reached by someone who can write in English by someone that not necessarily lives in an English-speaking country, I'd like to make it work the other way around too.

That's it, I hope that this BoK is useful for you!
