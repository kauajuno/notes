Nudge Theory is a behavioral science concept that focuses on understanding how subtle changes to the environment of an user can impact its decision-making process. Through nudge theory, it is possible to "direct" the user to their needs without having to apply heavy-handed rule sets that can even let the user feel too restrained. Some ways that nudge theory can be seen in action include:

- choice architecture: making an element that is usually more relevant at the top of a list or making it draw attention through its size and/or color.
- default: setting a default option encourages users to make better decisions.
- empiric social proof: showing how users that had a specific decision have achieved better results.
- timely interventions: showing support at the time it is really needed, such as providing a guide when the user reaches a more complex task.
