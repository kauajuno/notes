# Headings

Headings must always start with a capitalized letter and be followed by lowercase letters, being uppercase only if referring to something that needs to use uppercase letters such as acronyms or people.

Headings must also be surrounded by one blank line, except if it is the first line of a page, then only the lower bound must be a blank line.

## Sizing

It's only allowed to use headings from H1 to H3.

## Cascading headings

It's mandatory to use H2 only when there's a preceding H1, the same goes for H3 and H2.

# Tags

Each page shall have at least one tag. Tags are separated from the main content of the page via [slides](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Slides), in such way that the tags are kept in the last slide.

Each tag must be as generic as possible to avoid having lots of tags that will be used just a few times.

The main purpose of using tags is to help filtering pages in an easier way when the graph view of this vault becomes too dense.
