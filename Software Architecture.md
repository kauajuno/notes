Software architecture defines how an application is built in a higher-level vision in terms of detail. That means that software architecture isn't that much about the code, but rather about the bigger picture: where that code runs, how that code runs, how is the connection and communication implemented, which best practices are there for this, etc.

The result produced by software architecture is what is taken as input for the [[Software Design|software design]] to continue the work.
