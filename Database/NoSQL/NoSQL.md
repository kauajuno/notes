NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" and refers to a class of database management systems that don't adhere to the traditional relational model. Unlike relational databases, which use tables with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases offer more flexible data models to handle large and complex datasets. So as they're more flexible, they tend to be more different to each other in comparison to [[SQL]] [[DBMS|DBMSs]], and mechanics learned from one of them might not be useful to the other.
