SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a specialized language designed for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases. Think of it as the language you use to communicate with databases, allowing you to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information efficiently.

# Is SQL a programming language?

This is often the first question that comes to mind when we refer to SQL as a language. It kind of is and kind of isn't, it's hard to define. The fact is that it would be more accurate to describe it as a domain-specific language, as it can only be used to manipulate data in databases and won't be doing anything besides that like other general-purpose programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, etc.

# Is SQL the same for every [[DBMS]]?

Not exactly. Most of them follow a SQL standard making them very similar, but there might be some vendor-specific terms to different [[DBMS|DBMSs]]. For example, [[MySQL]] has specific functions such as GROUP_CONCAT, FIND_IN_SET and REGEXP.
