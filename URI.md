Uniform Resource Identifiers, mostly referred to as URIs, are used to identify resources such as documents, photos and other types of media.

# Syntax

An URI is composed by the following parts:

## Protocol

Specifies the protocol to be used in order to access the resource, most known ones are [[HTTP]] and [[HTTPS]].

## Domain

The domain specifies in which server the resource is being searched. google.com is an example of domain.

## Port

Indicates the gate used to access the resource on the web server. If the port is not defined in the URI, by default, the [[HTTP]] protocol uses port 80, and [[HTTPS]] uses port 443.

# Path

Represents the path for the resource on the web server.

## Query

Extra parameters in key-value format which can be provided to somehow filter the results.

## Fragment

A fragment is an reference to a specific part of the resource.
