Web [[API|APIs]] are a set of programming interfaces that allow web applications to interact with the browser's environment or external services. They provide a bridge between the [[JavaScript]] code running in the browser and the underlying system functionalities. The main purpose of them is to simplify the execution of more complex operations in web applications by providing a higher-level interface that abstracts away the complexity of the browser/external services environment.
