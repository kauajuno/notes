The Document Object Model is an [[API]] that represents web documents in a tree-like structure that has nodes and objects, enabling a programming language, usually [[JavaScript]], to interact with the documents. When referring to documents most will think of [[HTML]], which indeed is the most targeted document when thinking of DOM, but it's also possible to manipulate other document formats such as SVGs.
